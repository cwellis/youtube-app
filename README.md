Video Sharing App

Here, users can upload, and share videos with other users. They can like, dislike, and comment on videos. They can also subscribe and unsubscribe from other channels.

How It's Made: Tech used: REACT, Redux, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, MongoDB, Express, Firebase

This app was created using the MERN stack, usernames and passwords are saved under the user collection on MongoDB (passwords saved with bcrypt). Videos and imgs are hosted on Firebase, they are posted to Firebase when uploading a new video, and retrieved when clicking on specific video links. Users can like and dislike videos in app, and can add comments (currently only through Postman or MongoDB). The frontend components are created using styled components, which I read about on StackOverflow, and wanted to give a chance on using.

Optimizations: I would like for the comment feature to be fully functional in app, so that users can add comments to specific videos, and like those comments. Currently, comments can only be posted using Postman or MongoDB. As well as the comments, I would like for the views to be fully functional, so that whenever a video is clicked the view count increases.

Lessons Learned: I am very proud of this project even though there are features I still wish to add. This is my first time using Firebase and it went very smoothly, this entire project has helped me hone in on all of my skills as a developer. I enjoyed the new experience of using styled components, however if I were to make this project again I would probably use CSS instead as it is what I am more used to.
